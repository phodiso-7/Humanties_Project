# Predicting Counseling Dropout Risk

In real-world counseling—especially in substance abuse recovery programs—clients often discontinue treatment before completion. These dropouts can hinder recovery outcomes and strain support systems. By using machine learning to predict which clients are more likely to leave early, we can design proactive interventions to improve retention and care quality.

This project builds a predictive pipeline using real-world-inspired data to identify at-risk clients based on demographic, clinical, and psychosocial features. Models like decision trees and deep neural networks are used and compared to support evidence-based strategies for client retention.
